Exercise 2: Async/Await with Fetch API

Develop a JavaScript program that fetches data from an API using the Fetch API and utilizes async/await. Follow these steps:

Define an async function called fetchData that takes a URL as a parameter. Inside the fetchData function, use the Fetch API to make a GET request to the specified URL. Use the await keyword to wait for the response and convert it to JSON using the json method. Return the received data. In the calling code, call the fetchData function using await and manipulate/display the received data as desired.
