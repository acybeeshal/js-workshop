<!-- Exercise 1: Callback Functions with Fetch API

Write a JavaScript program that fetches data from an API using the Fetch API and utilizes callback functions. Follow these steps:

    Define a function called fetchData that takes a URL and a callback function as parameters.
    Inside the fetchData function, use the Fetch API to make a GET request to the specified URL.
    In the then method, convert the response to JSON using the json method.
    In the then method, call the callback function with the received data as the argument.
    Implement a callback function called processData that takes the received data as a parameter.
    Inside the processData function, manipulate and display the received data as desired. -->
